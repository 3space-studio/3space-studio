### Darkstar Game Engine

The third generation of Dynamix's [3Space](3space.md) game technology, designed to make it easier to create content from within the game and to externalise game logic into script files.

Many of the ideas present in Darkstar would be expanded upon with the [Torque](torque.md) engine.
