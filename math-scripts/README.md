SSR - The Starsiege Restoration Project

This is a small set of shims to add originally absent math functions to Starsiege which were present in Starsiege Tribes.

These functions are needed for the Tribes Math Library to work, though some functions may still be missing.

If you have sspm and you want to install it locally to your game, just type **sspm install starsiege-math-shims**.

Though, the audience for thses functions would be scripters who want to make use of the math library in their code.

Check out starisege-flyer-movement, which makes use of this shim: https://github.com/matthew-rindel/starsiege-flyer-movement
