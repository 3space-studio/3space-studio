## Purpose and Goals
Siege Installer is meant to enable the following: 
  * Allows for installation of a game from a phyiscal disc or compressed/disc archive.
  * Can work with multiple levels of archives (ISO file inside of a zip file).
  * Support for adding the game to a launcher such as GOG or Steam.
  * Support for adding a game to an existing entry in GOG or Steam, especially for sequels or related games (for example adding Fury3 to Terminal Velocity).
