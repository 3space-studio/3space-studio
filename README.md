# Darkstar DTS Converter

WARNING - Still being actively developed - It can convert models to OBJ, but still needs additional work.

This is a Python script designed to convert DTS files from the Darkstar Engine, used in Starsige and Starsiege: Tribes, into a more modern format.

The script is highly incomplete and not ready for use yet. However, currently, most of the DTS file can be unpacked and individual meshes (when testing) can be converted to OBJ format. Except when all of those meshes are exported together.

The ultimate goal will be to convert the files into a format such as 3DS or DAE, in addition to the goals below.

This is a learning project, with the intention being multifold:
* Learning to programme with Python
* Understanding 3D model formats better
* Providing new opportunities to mod or port the respective games' assets

Inspired by a DTS converter for Earthsiege 2 (https://github.com/booto/convert_dts)
